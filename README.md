# Handwiriting-Number-Recognition
A simple model with two-layer neural network,use for handwiriting number recognition.
download mnists dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/,or choose to download by pytorch.
mnists dataset should include 4 files:
    "train-images-idx3-ubyte",
    "train-labels-idx1-ubyte",
    "t10k-images-idx3-ubyte",
    "t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte".
The demo.py provides the function to load data, transform data formats, and randomly shuffle the data. All you need to do is download the dataset.
